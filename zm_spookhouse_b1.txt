Survivor Objectives

Here's the bet...
Go inside that house, enter and explore each and every room, make it back out alive.

First, you must not get lost in and around the mining operation.  There is a toxic ground gas seeping up
through the mines.  When the warning text appears, get out, ASAP!

Once at the house, survivors will have 6.66 minutes to explore all areas of the house.

Rooms not yet explored appear on the left of screen in red.  Complete objective and return to spawn area.


Zombie Master

Zombies will enter house and surrounding area through certain walls.  Try to bottle them up inside and block routes of escape.
