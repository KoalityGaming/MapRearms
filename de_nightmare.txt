de_nightmare - A map by AlphaKennyOne

Trapped in a living nightmare, Terrorists
plan to destroy the energy core, or the
magical portal of spinnyness. If the 
Counter-Terrorists want a shot at 
escaping this nightmare alive, 
these areas must be protected.

Deadly traps surround the portal, so watch it. 
There are workarounds to some of these,
but only those on the look out will know how 
to activate them.

Terrorists have also learned of a 
'safe haven', but have no clues, other 
than an inscription which read:

An extra area. Cannot be seen, but can
be reached. Getting to it will not be without 
sacrifice. Once you blow open the mystery 
of what's behind the secrets, blood will have 
to be shed. But with bloodshed, opens a new 
path. One that bridges the gap between what 
used to be out of reach. Don't be fooled by the 
obvious route. Your real goal may be right 
around the corner.
